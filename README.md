# breastCancer Classification Project - Machine Learning
## Overview
This project performs classification using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn (https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/datasets/toy_dataset.html). The dataset consists of 30 numerical features representing characteristics of breast tumor cells. The goal of this project is to classify tumors as malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous) using Decision Tree and Logistic Regression models.

## Goals
1. Training and Evaluating classification models to distinguish between malignant and benign tumors.
2. Comparing the accuracy of Decision Tree and Logictic Regression Models.
3. Visualizing decision boundaries and model performance.

## Insight
### Model Performace
- Decision Tree Accuracy: 91.23%
- Logistic Regression Accuracy: 100%

1. Logistic Regression performed exceptionally well, achieving 100% accuracy, which may indicate an ideal dataset separation or potential overfitting.
2. Decision Tree performed well but may require tuning to avoid overfitting.
3. Visualization of the decision boundary helps in understanding classification separability.
4. Feature scaling significantly improved the performance of Logistic Regression.

## Advice
Experiment with other classification models like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Random Forest to see if a more complex model gives better results.
